# TRAVEL GENIE
This project started as a fully functional Tourist Travel Agency Website, built using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. The platform was designed to provide a seamless and interactive user experience for travelers looking to explore destinations, book tours, and find curated travel packages.

But we didn't stop there. We've been actively working on integrating AI-driven features to enhance user experience, personalization, and automation.
